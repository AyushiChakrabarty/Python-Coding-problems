TWO SUM - (Easy)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.

(1) ------ BRUTE FORCE APPROACH------
class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        
        l = len(nums)
        for i in range(l):
            for j in range(i+1, l):
                if(nums[i] + nums[j]== target):
                    return [i,j]


This solution utilizes 2 for loops to iterate over a singe array in order to find the target pair.
Time complexity: O(n x n) = O (n^2)
Space complexity: O(1)
