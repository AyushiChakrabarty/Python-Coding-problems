#Python
#Problem Description
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

#----Usage of the concept of Stack------#
class Solution(object):
    def isValid(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        stack = []

        for c in s:
            if c in '({[':
                stack.append(c)
            else:
                if len(stack)==0 or \
                    (c==')' and stack[-1] != '(') or \
                    (c==']' and stack[-1] != '[') or \
                    (c=='}' and stack[-1] != '{'): 
                    return False
                stack.pop()
        return not stack

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(n)
