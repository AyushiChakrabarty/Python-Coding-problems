## Python
## Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Method: Sliding window technique (utilizes the hash table concept)

class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """

        seen = {}
        l = 0
        length = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            char = s[r]
            if char in seen and seen[char]>=l:
                l = seen[char] + 1
            else:
                length = max(length, r-l+1)
            seen[char] = r
        return length

Time Complexity: O(n)
